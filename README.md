# DS5760 NoSQL for Modern Data Science Applications:
# Mini Project 2 â€“ CareerHub: Building a Mini Job Portal with MongoDB and Flask

## About
CareerHub is a MongoDB based career portal database. It allows users to retrieve and modify job listings based on specific criteria.

## Requirements
CareerHub requires the following:
* Docker
* Python
* MongoDB
* PyMongo
* Flask

## Installation
The required tools can be installed via pip. As an example, the code block below shows how to install PyMongo.
```
pip install pymongo
```

## Setting up
1. Once all the requirements have been installed, the CSV files can be converted to json by running the csv_to_json.py file:
`pyton csv_to_json.py`

2. The MongoDB container is defined in the docker-compose.yml file, and can be started using the following command:
   `docker-compose up`

3. Access the mongo shell (this is required to import data from the json files)
   `docker compose-exec mongodb sh`

6. Once in the shell, data can be imported into the database using these lines:

   - `mongoimport --db careerhub --collection listings --file /ds5760/mongo/data/listings.json --jsonArray`
   - `mongoimport --db careerhub --collection company_and_industry_info  --file /ds5760/mongo/data/company_and_industry_info.json --jsonArray`

7. To verify that the imports are successful, we can run the following code:
`docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh`

This allows us to access the database and see what collections it contains.

8. Finally, run the flask app to start dynamically interacting with the CareerHub database.
   `python run-app.py`
